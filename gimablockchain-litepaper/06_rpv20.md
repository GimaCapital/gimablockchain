# Rug-Proof Vaults (RPV-20)

### Description
Rug-Proof Vaults (RPV-20) is an innovative token standard (`contracts/RPV20.sol`) extending ERC-20, designed to secure DeFi liquidity pools against rug pulls, which cost over $500 million annually (2024). By embedding time-locks, multi-signature approvals, and audit trails, RPV-20 ensures funds cannot be withdrawn without community consensus, protecting liquidity providers (LPs).

### Features
- **Time-Locks**: Locks deposited funds for a set period (e.g., 30 days) via `lockLiquidity(uint amount, uint duration)`, preventing sudden withdrawals unless 90% of LPs approve.
- **Multi-Signature Approvals**: Requires n-of-m signers (e.g., `emergencyWithdraw(address[] approvers)`) for critical actions, signed by Zenrock’s dMPC for enhanced security.
- **Audit Trails**: Logs all vault actions (deposits, withdrawals, approvals) on-chain, verifiable via block explorers, with Zenrock signatures for high-value operations.

### Implementation
- Deployed via `scripts/deploy_contracts.py`; verified with `scripts/verify_contracts.js`.
- Tested in `tests/contracts/test_rpv20.js` for time-lock enforcement and multi-sig logic.

### Example
An LP deposits 10 ETH into an RPV-20 vault integrated with a yield strategy. Funds are locked for 30 days, requiring DAO or 90% LP consensus for early withdrawal, ensuring rug-proof security.
