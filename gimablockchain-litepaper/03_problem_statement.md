# Problem Statement

The DeFi ecosystem faces critical barriers:

- **Rug Pulls**: Malicious actors exploit liquidity pools, causing over $500 million in annual losses (2024) due to inadequate governance and transparency.
- **Onboarding Friction**: Wallet setup and gas fees deter 80% of potential users, limiting retail and institutional participation.
- **Operational Complexity**: Secure token launches and yield strategies require cumbersome audits and approvals.
- **Yield Accessibility**: High-yield opportunities are often risky or inaccessible to non-technical users.
- **Cross-Chain Limitations**: Ethereum-centric protocols exclude users on high-performance or cost-efficient chains like Solana and BNB Smart Chain.
