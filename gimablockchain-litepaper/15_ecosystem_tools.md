# Ecosystem Tools

- **Software Development Kit (SDK)**: Open-source tools (`contracts/`, `apps/relayer-api`) for developers to integrate RPV-20 vaults, yield strategies, and badges into dApps.
- **Dashboard**: A web-based interface (`apps/frontend`) for users to manage vaults, badges, yields, and Trust Energy.
- **Future Plans**:
  - Mobile wallet for iOS/Android, supporting Gima ID and multi-chain interactions.
  - $50 million ecosystem fund to support developers building on Layer-2, Solana, and BNB Smart Chain.
