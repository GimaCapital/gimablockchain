# Solution

GimaBlockchain delivers a comprehensive DeFi security protocol to address these challenges:

- **Rug-Proof Vaults (RPV-20)**: A token standard with built-in time-locks and multi-signature approvals to secure liquidity pools.
- **GimaTrust Badges**: NFT-based certifications (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to verify projects and boost investor confidence, increasing vault yields by 2–5%.
- **GIMA Token**: A utility and governance token for staking (10–20% APY), voting, and transaction cost abstraction via Trust Energy (TE).
- **TokenFactory**: A smart contract for deploying secure RPV-20 tokens and badges, integrated with yield strategies.
- **Yield Strategies**: Smart contracts optimizing vault returns through external DeFi protocols, maintaining rug-proof protections.
- **Relayer-First Architecture**: Abstracts wallet and gas complexity using Gima ID and Zenrock’s dMPC for secure transaction signing.
- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Plans to extend RPV-20, badges, yield strategies, and onboarding to Solana and BNB Smart Chain by 2026 via cross-chain messaging, native deployments, or unified identity layers.
