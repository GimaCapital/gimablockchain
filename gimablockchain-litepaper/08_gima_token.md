# GIMA Token

### Description
The GIMA token is a utility and governance token deployed via `TokenFactory.sol`, with a total supply of 1 billion, 40% allocated to the community, and a 1% transaction burn.

### Uses
- **Staking**: Earns 10–20% APY via `StakingRewards.sol`.
- **Governance**: Enables voting on badge issuance, yield strategy parameters, and protocol upgrades (`Governance.sol`).
- **Trust Energy (TE)**: Discounts transaction costs, abstracted by the Relayer.

### Deployment
Optimized for Ethereum Layer-2’s low-cost transactions.

### Future
Planned support for Solana and BNB Smart Chain via native token deployments or cross-chain messaging.
