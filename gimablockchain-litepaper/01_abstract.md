# Abstract

GimaBlockchain is a decentralized finance (DeFi) security protocol deployed on Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, designed to eliminate rug pulls and democratize DeFi participation. The protocol introduces **Rug-Proof Vaults (RPV-20)**, an innovative token standard extending ERC-20 with time-locks and multi-signature approvals to secure liquidity pools against over $500 million in annual losses (2024 data). **GimaTrust Badges** provide NFT-based certifications to enhance trust, while the **GIMA token** facilitates staking and governance. The **TokenFactory** enables secure token creation, and **yield strategies** optimize returns (10–20% annual percentage yield, APY) through integration with external DeFi protocols. A **Relayer-first architecture**, powered by Zenrock’s distributed Multi-Party Computation (dMPC), abstracts transaction complexity, and the **Gima ID** system delivers Web2-like onboarding. Planned expansion to Solana and BNB Smart Chain by 2026 via cross-chain messaging, native deployments, or unified identity layers ensures broad accessibility. GimaBlockchain combines robust security, high-yield opportunities, and seamless user experiences to redefine trust in DeFi.
